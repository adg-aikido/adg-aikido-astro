      The weekend seminar will be led by Sensei Lewis Bernaldo de Quirós, 7th Dan
      Aikikai and Technical Director of Traditional Aikido Europe (TAE).

      **Sensei de Quirós** trained full-time under the late Morihiro Saito Sensei (9th
      Dan) from 1986 until 1993 in the Iwama Dojo in Japan. Prior to beginning his
      training in Aikido, he trained for 10 years in both Judo and Karate (Shotokan
      Karate under the late Keinosuke Enoeda Sensei 9th Dan in London). During his
      stay in Japan, he also practiced Kyudo (Traditional Japanese Archery),
      Japanese calligraphy and Zen.

      Since returning from Japan, he has taught Aikido on a full time basis and to
      date has conducted well over 350 international seminars. After returning from
      Japan he maintained regular contact with his teacher through seminars both as
      a participant as well as assistant and translator until his passing away in
      2002.

      Lewis sensei received the rank of 5th Dan Aikikai from Morihiro Saito Sensei
      in 1999 and 6th Dan Aikikai from Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba (Hombu Dojo Tokyo) in
      2009. In 2024 he was awarded the rank of 7th Dan Aikikai.

      He is the Senior Instructor and Examiner on behalf of Hombu Dojo of a European
      network of Dojos (TAE) committed to developing, researching and
      transmitting the style of Aikido known as Takemusu Aikido (Iwama
      Aikido) which was transmitted directly to Morihiro Saito Sensei from
      the Founder of Aikido Morihei Ueshiba during his more than 23-years as
      a direct student at the Founder's Dojo in Iwama Japan.
